- This is an Express Vite app with:
  - Express server code in `src/server`
  - React client code in `src/client`
  - Genkit AI code in `src/ai`
- This app uses Tailwind v4, read TAILWIND.md if you need to do style stuff.
- Use `kebab-case` for filenames consistently.
- Components should be created in `src/client/components`. In general create small encapsulated components over large files.
- Make sure there are no TypeScript errors before considering a task complete.
- Never run long-running servers. I'll do that.
